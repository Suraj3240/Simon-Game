# Simon-Game

This is a game I have made during Web Dev course.

I have used jQuery to implement this game.

> In case you don't know how to play this game, here is a [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWJ5uYwQJGU&ab_channel=TripleSGames) you can refer to.

It was great fun making this mini game.
